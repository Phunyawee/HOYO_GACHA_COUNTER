*   **Target Date:** Set a deadline (e.g., next banner release).
*   **Income Calculation:** Auto-calculates Welkin/Daily commissions.
*   **Flexible Inputs:** Add estimated event rewards or abyss clears manually.

### 🎰 3. Monte Carlo Simulator
"Will I win the 50/50?" — The simulator runs **100,000 runs** in seconds to tell you the odds based on your *actual* budget.

*   **Realistic Logic:** Uses the exact Soft Pity (74) and Hard Pity (90) logic from the game.
*   **Visual Probability:** See the distribution of outcomes in a histogram.
*   **Win Rate:** Get a precise percentage chance of success.

### 🛡️ 4. System Stability & Telemetry
We made the tool robust for daily use.

*   **Auto-Backup:** Your history is automatically backed up to a safe folder every time you fetch data.
*   **Crash Catcher:** The app now intelligently catches errors and logs them to `debug_session.log` instead of just closing.
