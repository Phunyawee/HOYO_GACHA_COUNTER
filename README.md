# 🌠 HOYO Gacha Link Extractor

A simple, safe, and lightweight tool to extract Gacha History Link for **Genshin Impact** & **Honkai: Star Rail**.

> 💡 **Why use this?** Unlike other tools, this script reads local cache files directly. **No Admin permission required** and **No external API calls** for extracting keys.

## ✨ Features
- 🔒 **Safe:** Works with local files on your machine.
- 🚀 **Simple:** Just point to the cache file. No complex setup.
- 🛡️ **No Admin Needed:** Runs safely without elevated privileges.

## ⚠️ Limitation
Please note that game servers only keep your wish history for the last **6 months** (or 1 year for some banners).
* This tool **cannot** retrieve data older than what is stored on the server.
* If you haven't pulled in a long time, your history list might appear empty.
